<h2>Document & Image Annotation Widget for Your Website</h2>
This plugin adds comprehensive <a href="http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library" target="_blank">document & image annotation</a> functionality to SilverStripe CMS. It integrates the downloadable .NET version of the GroupDocs.Annotation library into your website. Once installed, you will be able to embed and display more than 50 different types of documents and images along with an annotation widget on any page within your website. Key features and benefits include:

<strong>Support for 50+ File Formats</strong>
To name just a few, GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET allows your website users to view and annotate PDF files, Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, CAD drawings, raster images and many more.

<strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>
Documents embedded to your website with GroupDocs.Annotation, can be viewed/annotated using any standard web-browser. You don’t have to worry about whether your website users have the software required to open the documents.

<strong>Collaborative Review & Annotation Sessions</strong>
GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET allows multiple users to annotate the same document simultaneously. Users can invite co-workers, partners and customers to review a document online, add annotations and see others’ comments in real-time. Annotated documents can then be printed out or exported to a PDF file along with the annotations in them.

<strong>A Wide Set of Annotation Tools</strong>
With over 14 annotation tools that come with the library, users can: add sticky notes, comment on a selected area or text, drop arrows, draw freehand lines, highlight an area with a rectangle, underline or strikethrough selected text, add watermarks, hide sensitive data with redactions, measure distance between objects within a document, etc.

<strong>Secure Document Sharing</strong>
Documents embedded to your website are not downloaded to user machines during view & annotation sessions. They are rendered in user web-browsers just like a standard web-page. Combined with the in-built DRM (Digital Rights Management) feature, this allows you to share documents in a “read-only” mode. You can configure GroupDocs.Annotation to prevent users from copying, downloading or printing some or all of the documents displayed on your website.

<h3>Installing the Add-on</h3>
Please note: this add-on requires the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library to be installed on your server first. For more details on the library and to download a free evaluation copy, please refer to the GroupDocs website:
